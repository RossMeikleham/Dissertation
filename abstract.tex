In the past most software was written with serial computation in mind 
and increases in processor speeds over time would in turn increase the speed 
the software ran at.
However with the rate of increase in processor speeds declining and 
manufacturers focusing on adding more processor cores this is no longer the case.
The result is that serially written software needs to be rewritten
if it wishes to take advantage of multiple processors. This project
focuses on designing a language which is familiar to most programmers
that describes the composition of serial tasks written in C++ and
can be executed in parallel.
