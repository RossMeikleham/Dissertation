The Glasgow Parallel Reduction Machine is a framework which focuses
on composition of tasks. It takes C++ code, and "glue code" GPIR (Glasgow
Parallel Intermediate Representation Language". An S-Expression like
language. However this language is difficult to write in and as such
a front end language which is easier for programmers familiar in
C like-language syntax to understand and write code in.
