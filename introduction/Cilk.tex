Cilk Plus is a general purpose programming language based on C++. It extends the C++ language with features such as
parallel for loops and spawning functions in parallel using a "fork-join" model to achieve task-parallelism.

One of the main princeples of the Cilk language is that the programmer should be responsible for exposing the parallelism
in their code. The runtime should then have the responsibility of scheduling the threads, and dividing work between
processors.
