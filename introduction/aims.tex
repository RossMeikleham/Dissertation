\section{Project Aims}

The GPIR language isn't really suitable for programming in. For one it requires the programmer to manually
manage which thread each task is allocated to. The language is also inconsistent with the C++ language used for 
the other parts of the framework (Calling code and Class Kernels). A language closer to C/C++ is more
consistent with the entire framework.

The aim of this project is to design a C-like language which can be evaluated in parallel by default, and build
a compiler for it. The compiler should be able to compile this new language down to GPIR code. The new language will
be called " Glasgow Parallel C" or "GPC" for short.

The language should be easy to pick up and write programs in for anyone familiar with the C/C++ languages.
To achieve this the language should be as close to C/C++ as possible. 

The language should also abstract away the details of allocating tasks to threads, this job
should be part of the compiler.
