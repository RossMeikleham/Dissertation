\section{Open MP}

OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is a language extension available for C, C++ and Fortran which allows for shared memory multi-processing. 
This is achieved by the use of compiler directives (more specifically in C/C++ this is done through the preprocessor using pragmas). 
This allows a compiler which doesn't implement OpenMP extensions to still compile C/C++ code
and run it in a linear fashion, and serial code can be made parallel purely through the use of preprocessor
directives without modification to the actual source code.
