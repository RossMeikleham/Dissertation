The goal is to create a C-like language which then compiles down to GPIR code.
The language should be as C-like as possible ideally we would like it to be as much
of a complete subset of C++ as possible, as the reset of the framework (Task Kernels and calling code)
are written in C++ and is more consistent with how the entire framework works.

C++ is a statically typed imperative language, and GPIR is a dynamically typed functional language.
Therefore the language design has to be one which can be succesfully mapped onto GPIR code.

Design decision:
    Single assignment:
       Variables in GPC can only be assigned once per scope.

       for example the following wouldn't be allowed
           int i = 0;
           int i = i + 1;

       but the following would be:
           int i = 0;
           {
               int i = i;
           }
