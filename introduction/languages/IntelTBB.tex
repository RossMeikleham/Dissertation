\subsection{Intel TBB}

Intell TBB (Intell Thread Building Blocks) is a portable C++ template library for task parallelism.
It contains a range of concurrent algorithms, containers, and it's own task scheduler to achieve this\cite{tbb}.

Operations are treated as tasks, and the task scheduler has the job of dynamically allocating these tasks 
to individual cores which abstracts the specific details of allocating threads from the Programmer. Like CilkPlus,
Intell TBB's task scheduler also implements task stealing for dynamic load balancing\cite{tbbschedule}.

Intell TBB relies on generic programming which allows for writing parallel algorithms based on 
requirements on types. Parallel code can be written once and can work with lots of different
types without having to rewrite the algorithm for each type \cite{tbbbenefits}.
