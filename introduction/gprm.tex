\section{What is the GPRM}

The Glasgow Parallel Reduction Machine is a virtual machine framework for multi-core programming using a task-based approach. It allows the programmer to structure their programs as a seperation of task-code (written as C++ classes) and communication code. 

The current communication language (GPIR) is a purely functional S-expression based language which is evaluated in parallel by default with optional sequential
evaluation semantics. This calls the task-code and controls the parallel/sequential execution of tasks. The GPIR code is compiled down further
to GPRM byte-code which is evaluated by the GPRM virtual machine.

Te GPRM uses task nodes which consists of a task kernel and a task manager.

Task code is represeted as a task kernel. A task kernel is a self contained unit, typically represented as a C++ class.
To create a task kernel, the C++ class needs to be in the GPRM::Kernel::namespace.

Communication code is represented as a task manager. A task manager "co-ordinates" communication between one or more task kernels, and
is represented as a function which can be called from a C++ program.\cite{GPRM}
