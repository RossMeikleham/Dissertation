GPC a front end C-like compiler for the Glasgow Parallel Reduction Machine.


The Glasgow Parallel Reduction Machine (GPRM) is a framework designed
to execute sequential mutually exclusive tasks in parallel, taking
the burden off the programmer to make use of many core systems. 

Problem Definition

The communication code uses an intermeddiate language called GPIR
GPIR is a functional. The aim of this project is to build a language which is
a thin layer above GPIR that compiles down to it.

Requirements

The language must support the following features
    - functions
    - objects 
    - options for sequential execution of statements
    - completely functional, no multi assignment
