\chapter{Future Work}

Future Features that could be added:

\section{Configuration file generation}
    yml config generation.
    These files are needed by the GPRM to determine aliases in GPIR code, libraries used,
    number of threads/nodes. There is enough information at compilation time to generate these,
    and they are currently generated manually. 


\section{Language Features}
    Other C++ language features, C++11 lambdas may be useful,
    while-loops, and possibly some STL support e.g. ability to use STD vector instead of pointers.

\section{Compiler Optimisations}

    There are a few optimisations that can be performed by the compiler to reduce the work needed to be 
    performed by the GPRM at runtime.

\subsection{Binary Expressions}
    Currently the evaluator will left fold over values that are known at compile time,
