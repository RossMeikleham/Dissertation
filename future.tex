\chapter{Future Work}

Future Features that could be added:
    yml config generation.
    These files are needed by the GPRM to determine aliases in GPIR code, libraries used,
    number of threads/nodes. There is enough information at compilation time to generate these,
    and they are currently generated manually. 

    Other C++ language features, C++11 lambdas may be useful,
    while-loops, and possibly some STL support e.g. ability to use STD vector instead of pointers.
